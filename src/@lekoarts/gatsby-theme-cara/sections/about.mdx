## About

##### I'm a web developer driven by curiosity and creativity to deliver high impact IT development for future-focused businesses.

A full skillset coupled with creative flair plus an easy manner and excellent English language skills make me perfectly-placed for IT outsourcing and IT contract projects.

I can easily attend meetings in Europe if required, thanks to regular direct flights from Budapest, Hungary, where I am based.
